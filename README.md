# Exploring-Deep-Learning-techniques-with-Keras
Analyzing the effects of changing optimizer, loss function, epochs, activation functions, and regularization methods on binary classification data.

I explored the several options in Keras Deep Learning library to see how the models perform over metrics like accuracy, AUC etc. I plotted those metrics over several learning rates and regularization parameters to see how these models perform. 

**Data**

1) Molecular Activity data
2) Diabetes data

**Loss Functions**

1) Binary Cross Entropy
2) Mean Square Error
3) Categorical Cross Entropy

**Activation functions**

1) Linear
2) RELU
3) Tanh
4) Sigmoid
5) Softmax

**Optimizers**

1) ADAM
2) Stochastic Gradient Descent
